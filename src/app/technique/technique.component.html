          Having good technique is crucial when it comes to making precise shots. Even with a perfectly straight cue ball,
          many players struggle to hit their target when they start to feather the ball. One way to improve this is by
          focusing on two fixed points while feathering. This helps to maintain a straight line and improve accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>- The first key element in maintaining a straight line while feathering is the bridge. It's important to keep
          in mind that it can only serve as a fixed point if it stays steady and doesn't move.<br>
          - Another important fixed point to consider is the body. By keeping a steady and consistent posture,
          the body can serve as a reference point to ensure that the cue stick is moving in a straight line.</p>
        <p>
          To enhance the stability of the guidance cue, we can add two additional fixed points. To do this, we can lean
          over the table and rotate our shoulders by 90 degrees, while also contracting our chest and chin towards the cue.
          Initially, we should position the cue on the firing line and then allow our body to lean against the cue.
          This will simplify the process of guiding the cue while feathering.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/image/vincent_pos_001.png" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail rounded" alt="good position by table (Vincent from Blender Studio)" style="width: 1100px;">
        <p>
          <br>
          A common mistake among players is to move the cue towards their body when attempting to lean on it.
          This causes the cue to no longer be aligned with the line of fire, which can negatively impact accuracy.
          Instead, it's important to maintain the proper positioning of the cue while leaning on it to ensure proper
          shot alignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The location at which we grip the cue can greatly affect the movement of the pointer during feathering.
          Holding the cue too close to the end can result in limited movement and difficulty in adjusting for accuracy.
          On the other hand, gripping the cue too far away from the white ball can also cause a short movement of
          the cue and affect the accuracy of the shot. It is important to find a balance between the distance of
          the grip from the end of the cue and the distance from the white ball for optimal feathering.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Remember:</b> When taking a shot, it is important to not lean the cue against your body, but instead,
          let your body lean against the cue. This will ensure that your shot is stable and accurate.
          By keeping your body in the proper position and allowing it to support the cue, you can reduce the chances of
          any unwanted movements that can affect the accuracy of your shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that the handle of the cue is the core of the game. The shoulder joint is like the ball and it ultimately
          determines the position of the elbow. The elbow is a hinge joint, which means it only moves in one plane.
          The wrist is multi-functional and works in harmony with the elbow joint. The control of the cue is achieved
          through the fleshy network of skin between the thumb and forefinger. When gripping the cue, I hinge it with
          my index finger and close it with my thumb. This is the fundamental aspect of the grip. Then, by closing the
          other fingers and moving the cue forward and backward, I can develop the control of these fingers.
          The fingers should always be in contact with the cue during the shot.

        <br>
        <p>
          Proper finger development is crucial when pulling back the cue to ensure that the cue is guided parallel to
          the table. If the fingers are not developed, the cue will swing and the shot will not be accurate.
          Furthermore, if a grip is used without developing the fingers, the body will engage additional muscles
          and activate the shoulder joint, which can lead to mistakes. It's important to work on finger development
          to make sure that the cue is controlled and guided parallel to the table, without the need to use additional muscles.

        <br>
        <p>
          It's important to ensure that at the moment of contact between the cue tip and the cue ball, the forearm and
          cue form a right angle. This position aligns the cue most parallel to the table. If the cue is pulled back
          with the tip pointing upwards, it will not be parallel to the table at the moment of contact and can negatively
          impact the shot's accuracy. To have the best shot outcome, the cue should be parallel to the table at
          the moment of contact with the cue ball.

          Forming a proper bridge is important for accurate shots. Here's how to do it:<br>
          <b>1.</b> Place your palm flat on the table, spreading your fingers to the desired width.<br>
          <b>2.</b> Carefully lift your knuckles by pulling the pads of your fingers across the table,
          making sure that the entire pads are resting on the surface.<br>
          <b>3.</b> Keep your fingers straight as you slide your thumb into the middle of your fingers and lock it onto your
          index finger. This will provide stability for the bridge.<br>
          <b>4.</b> The final result should be an indentation that resembles a letter V, through which the cue can pass.
          This will provide a stable base for the cue and allow for precise shots.

        </h6>
        <p>
          The ability to properly position your hands and set a stable bridge while playing pool is affected by the
          position of the white ball on the table. It is important to note that the position of the other balls on the
          table does not play a role in this. When the cue ball is near the edge of the table, it can become more difficult
          to set a stable bridge. In these cases, it may be necessary to slightly adjust the position of your hands
          and the bridge to maintain proper form. Additionally, the distance between the bridge and the hand holding
          the cue should remain consistent, and any adjustments made to the position of the sternum should be reflected
          in the position of the hand holding the cue. While these guidelines can help improve your snooker game,
          it is important to remember that they are not set in stone and may vary depending on the situation.

          Bridge on the edge of the table.
        </h6>
        <p>
          When the cue ball is close to the cushion and a traditional bridge is not possible, there are alternative
          bridge techniques that can be used. One option is the "mechanic's bridge", where the base of the bridge
          hand is positioned on the cushion and the fingers support the cue. Another option is the "fingertip bridge",
          where the fingertips of the bridge hand are used to support the cue, rather than the base of the hand.
          A third option is the "rail bridge" where the cue is rested on the rail of the pool table instead of the
          bridge hand. These alternative bridges can be used to make a shot when a traditional bridge is not possible
          due to the position of the cue ball.

        </h6>
        <p>
          Maintaining proper posture and stability is crucial for making accurate and powerful strokes while playing snooker.
          The stability of the bridge hand and the body play an important role in this. Keeping your body immobile
          and stable during a shot will improve your game. To achieve this, it's important to focus on maintaining
          a balanced and steady stance while you play. This can be done by keeping your feet firmly planted on the ground,
          and distributing your weight evenly between them. Additionally, it's important to engage core muscles to keep
          your body still and in control during a shot. By working on stability and maintaining a stationary body,
          you'll be able to make more accurate and powerful strokes while playing snooker.

        <br>
        <p>
          To establish a proper stance while playing snooker, it's important to first determine your firing line,
          which is the line that your cue will follow during the shot. To do this, align your right leg with the
          line of the shot, as this is the leg that will hold the cue. Your left leg should be positioned slightly
          wider than your hips to provide added stability. To increase longitudinal stability, which is stability
          along the line of the shot, move your left leg forward about 30cm and bend it slightly at the knee.
          Your right leg should remain straight. This stance will provide comfort and stability when striking the white ball.

          Players frequently encounter difficulty with unintended cue rotations, as they struggle to properly align
          the cue with the white ball. This results in missed shots, as the ball fails to enter the pocket.
        </p>
        <h6>What are they starting to do?</h6>
        <p>
          Another issue that arises from improper cue alignment is that players may adjust their targeting, believing
          they are shooting correctly, while in reality they have altered the line of impact by counteracting
          the off-center stroke on the white ball. This can lead to confusion and frustration, as players may think
          they are making the correct shots, but the ball still falls short of the pocket.

        <br>
        <p>
          One technique to ensure proper cue alignment on the white ball is to use a bridge loop. This involves placing
          the bridge cue on the table and leaning over the white ball to view the target from above. By doing this,
          you can see where you are actually aiming and how your brain interprets this. You can then adjust your aim
          and perception of the center of the white ball, so that your brain correctly interprets the center of the cue ball.
          This can be done by repeating this process often enough, so that the brain will change its interpretation and
          perception of the center will change, allowing you to strike the cue ball accurately.

          Two exercises that check if you play straight:
        </h6>
        <p>
          A simple exercise to determine if you are striking the center of the cue ball is to aim the cue ball over
          the spots of the colored balls on the table. Position the cue ball slightly in front of the point of the brown ball,
          and use that point as a reference to check if you are hitting the center. After each shot, try to keep the cue
          still so that white ball it hits the tip (cue) upon return. This will help you to gauge if you are hitting
          the center of the cue ball and make adjustments as necessary.<br>
          <b>(Cue ball by points - #101)</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          A more advanced exercise to check if you are hitting the center of the white ball is to aim at the white ball
          and hit it on the blue. After the blue ball passes through the point of the pink and black ball,
          it should deflect off the cushion and return to hit the white ball. This exercise will help you to
          determine if you are hitting the center of the white ball by observing the trajectory of the blue ball
          and adjusting accordingly.<br>

          Once you have determined the line of fire and made any necessary adjustments, it is important to execute the
          cue action smoothly and calmly. Avoid any quick or sudden movements, and try to keep the number of repetitions consistent.
          Before making the stroke, take a momentary pause to ensure that your aim and execution are correct.
          This will help you to make accurate shots and improve your overall performance.
        </p>
        <h6>
          Why the cue action?
        </h6>
        <p>
          The cue action is the deliberate and controlled movement of the cue  in order to make the shot. It is important
          to keep the cue action calm, so that your motor skills are relaxed and the shot is executed smoothly.
          This will help to ensure that the cue ball is hit as precisely as possible.
        </p>
        <h6>
          Why the pause?
        </h6>
        <p>
          The pause before the shot is crucial to maintaining control and accuracy. Without a pause, the cue may
          accelerate too quickly upon impact, causing the shot to be executed poorly. This can lead to a lack of
          control and difficulty in keeping the cue in a straight line. Pausing before the shot will help to maintain
          control and ensure a smooth and accurate execution.

          2. Second extraction<br>
          3. Third extraction<br>
          4. Fourth pullback and first pause<br>
          5. Smoothly bringing the cue forward with appropriate dynamics<br>
          6. The strike is followed by a natural deceleration of the cue and a second pause<br>
          7. In this position after the shot we stay for a while
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to the cue action, we can select the strength of the impact. If I want to play a light stroke my
          feathering should have short lashings, while if I want to play a strong shot of the blow should be longer.

          <b>Where do you look when hitting the white ball?</b> When striking the white ball, you should look at
          the ball that you are trying to hit. It is not recommended to look at the ball that has just been played
          (the cue ball) as this can affect your aim and accuracy.
        </p>
        <h6>
          This can be done in three ways:
        </h6>
        <p>
          <b>The first way -</b> We prepare to strike and look at the white ball and the ball being played, keeping our
          eyes focused on the cue as it moves back and forth. We make sure to watch the cue as it moves along the line
          of impact. This method allows us to see how the cue is moving and adjust the strike if necessary. However,
          it takes more focus to keep our eyes on the cue instead of the ball being played.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The second way -</b> We prepare to strike by keeping our eyes on the white ball and the ball to be struck.
          We focus on the point of impact and make the strike without looking at the cue as it retreats.
          This method allows for quick and precise strikes, but it can be difficult to gauge the power
          of the shot without visually tracking the cue.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The third way -</b> We prepare to strike by looking at the cue ball and aiming, then we focus on the cue
          as it moves back and forth. We make sure to watch the cue as it stops before the strike, then we look at
          the ball being played and strike. This method allows for precision and control of the cue, as well as
          giving us ample time to focus on the ball being played.

        <h6>
          Where to position the dominant eye and where to hold the head during impact?
        </h6>
        <p>
          When the players fold up to hit and start the cue action, you may notice that some players cue more under the
          right or left eye. This is because they have one eye more dominant, so if the right eye is dominant
          cue will be more under the right eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine which eye is dominant, follow these steps:<br>
          <b>1.</b> Place a ball on a table.<br>
          <b>2.</b> Cut a hole in a piece of paper and hold it in front of your straightened arms.<br>
          <b>3.</b> Look through the hole at the ball and close your left eye. If you can still see the ball, your right eye is dominant.<br>
          <b>4.</b> Repeat the process, but this time close your right eye. If the ball disappears, your left eye is dominant.<br>

          Hitting balls straight on is relatively easy when our technique is sound, but when it comes to pocketing
          at specific angles, things can become challenging. One of the most common dilemmas faced by novice snooker
          players is how to properly aim and strike the cue ball in order to pocket it. The key is to understand
          how to recognize the correct angles and apply the right technique to ensure the ball falls into the pocket.
          This requires practice and a good understanding of geometry and the physics of the game. Learning how
          to read and utilize the angles on the table is crucial in becoming a skilled snooker player.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we have a shot where the cue ball is at an angle to both the object ball and the pocket,
          we can approach the shot in two different ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The first way</b> One approach to hitting angled shots is to practice striking the cue ball at different
          points on its surface. This can include hitting the ball full-on, at a 3/4 position, a 1/2 position,
          or a 1/4 position. Through practice, you will develop the ability to recognize the precise point of
          contact and make small adjustments in your stroke to pocket the ball more accurately.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
          <b>The second way</b> Another method for hitting angled shots is to visualize an imaginary "ghost ball" that
          is tangent to the object ball and in line with the pocket. Stand in line with this ghost ball, and use
          it as a guide for your shot. Focus on the center of the ghost ball as you set up and take your shot,
          without looking away from the ghost ball. This can help you aim more accurately and increase your chances
          of pocketing the object ball.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/image/angle4.png" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail rounded" alt="good position by table (Vincent from Blender Studio)" style="width: 1100px;">

        <br>
        <p>
          A combination of both of these methods can be the most effective way to improve your ability to hit angled shots.
          Practice hitting the ball from different angles, and before each shot, take a moment to visualize the ghost ball.
          This approach allows you to receive feedback from both your physical practice and your visualized shots. Over time,
          this routine and repetition will help you develop a sense of the correct angle for a shot both physically and mentally.
          The key is to keep up a consistent routine, as this is how you will develop muscle memory and improve your ability
          to recognize and execute angled shots.

          <b>TOP SPIN, BACK SPIN, LEFT SIDE, RIGHT SIDE</b> <br> In order to apply spin to the cue ball in basic shots,
          you should focus on striking the ball at different points along its circumference. When practicing these strokes,
          it is important to pay attention to the angle of your cue stick and the speed at which you strike the ball.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>To master snooker, it is essential to master three basic types of strokes. These include:</i><br>
          <b>1.</b> Hitting the ball with progressive spin, which will cause the cue ball to move forward while rotating.<br>
          <b>2.</b> Hitting the ball without any spin, which will cause the cue ball to move in a straight path without rotation.<br>
          <b>3.</b> Hitting the ball with backward spin, which will cause the cue ball to move backwards while rotating.

        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to practice these strokes regularly and to pay attention to the specifics of each stroke in order to improve your overall game.
        </p>
        <h6>
          IMPORTANT:
          <p>
            When applying spin to the cue ball, it is important to ensure that the tip of your cue stick is properly chalked.
            This will help to increase friction between the cue tip and the ball, allowing for more control and precision
            when applying spin. Additionally, check that the chalk is not too old or worn out, as this can also affect the
            grip of the cue tip on the ball.
          </p>
        </h6>

        <p>
          <b>Top spin</b> One way to apply a forward spin to the cue ball is to use a "top spin" shot.
          To execute this shot, you should raise the bridge of your hand and strike the top of the cue ball.
          This causes the cue ball to rotate forward and move forward after striking the object ball.
          The cue ball will roll forward behind the object ball. It's important to practice this shot to get
          the right touch and feel of the cue ball and object ball interaction.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Stop ball</b> Another basic shot is hitting the cue ball dead center, without any spin. To execute this shot,
          you will need to slightly lower the bridge of your hand, and aim for the center of the cue ball. This will
          cause the cue ball to slide down the cloth and come into contact with the object ball, while the white ball
          remains in the same spot. This shot is important to master as it will allow you to control the cue ball's
          speed and trajectory more precisely.

        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Back spin</b> A third basic shot is the "back spin" shot. To execute this shot, you will need to place the
          bridge of your hand flat on the table, and strike the cue ball from a downward angle. This will cause the cue
          ball to rotate backwards and move backwards after striking the object ball. This shot is useful when you need
          to play a safety shot and keep the cue ball away from the pocket and also push the object ball away from the
          pocket. It takes practice to master the right angle and power to achieve the desired backward rotation on the cue ball.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/image/back_spin.png" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail rounded" alt="back spin (Vincent from Blender Studio)" style="width: 1100px;">
        <br>
        <h6>
          IMPORTANT:
          <p>
            When applying back spin, it is crucial to ensure that the cue is guided in a parallel manner.<br>
            If parallelism and stability are not maintained while guiding the cue, the white ball may jump.
          </p>
        </h6>

        <p>
          After becoming proficient at pocketing the cue ball using various spin techniques such as top spin, stop ball,
          and back spin, the next step is to incorporate the use of the side stroke. This technique can have a significant
          impact on the snooker table, particularly when it comes into contact with an edge on the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we increase the amount of lateral rotation, the deviation effect also increases. The greatest deviation
          will occur when the cue ball makes contact on the left side of the white ball. After bouncing off the edge
          of the table, the cue ball will deviate the most to the left. However, if the cue hits closer to the center,
          the deviation will be less pronounced.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p class="cytat">
          It's essential to keep in mind that when utilizing side rotation, the cue ball will deviate slightly from the
          intended shot line. This must be taken into account when aiming, in order to achieve the desired outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>When using lateral rotation in a game of snooker,</b> it's important to take into account the effect of friction
          that a fiber hair can have on the shot. This added complexity must be considered when aiming and executing
          the shot for optimal results.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you run your hand along the table surface from the top of the table towards the point of the black ball,
          the table feels smooth. However, if you run your hand in the opposite direction, from the point of the black
          ball towards the top of the table, you can feel the small fibers of the cloth. This type of cloth arrangement
          can have a significant impact on the rolling of the cue ball, especially when lateral rotation is applied during the shot.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/image/cloth.png" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail rounded" alt="cloth (Vincent from Blender Studio)" style="width: 1100px;">
        <br>
        <p>
          When the white ball is hit with rotation towards the point of the black cue ball, it will travel in a
          slight arc shape. On the other hand, if the white ball is hit with side rotation but
          in the direction of the base from the point of the black ball, the white ball will travel with a slight slant.

          Both novice players and experienced players can have difficulty using auxiliary instruments.
          It is crucial for the cue to move in a straight and stable manner on the plane of impact.
          If the feathering deviates from the aiming line, the cue will fly off to one side or the other when the
          shot is fired, resulting in a miss. To avoid this, it's important to keep the cue on a flat surface
          and hit the ball directly.

        <br>
        <p>
          When practicing shots with auxiliary instruments, a helpful tip is to align the device along the shot line
          and guide the cue directly over and along the instrument. This provides a useful reference point to ensure
          that your strokes are being made in a straight line.

          Pressure is an unavoidable part of competition, particularly when a particular shot holds a lot of significance.
          Even a straightforward shot can prove challenging due to the weight of the situation.
          Stress is often perceived as a feeling of unease in a specific scenario and can manifest
          as a state of tension. Our body's reaction to stress, like tensed neck and shoulder muscles,
          can make it hard to execute a proper shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stressors trigger various response mechanisms that are both physiological and psychological.
          When under stress, our body starts to secrete hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. In a game like snooker,
          this is not ideal as it can introduce unwanted movements during the shot. It's crucial for the player
          to remain as calm as possible during the stroke in order to execute the shot accurately.

          How to deal with stress?
        </h6>
        <p>
          <b>The first</b> The first and most important way to handle stress during a game of snooker is to develop
          and practice a good technique. A solid technique forms the foundation of the game and can give an advantage
          in stressful situations. To achieve this, it's essential to invest time in training your technique on a regular basis.<br>
          <b>The second</b> Another way to deal with stress is through breathing exercises, taking a deep breath and
          exhaling slowly a few seconds before an important shot can help the body relax and regulate breathing.<br>
          <b>The third</b> Visualization is also an important method to handle stress, by visualizing the shot
          before execution can help players to play the shot as they planned.
        </p>
        <p>
          By combining these methods, players will be able to handle stress better and perform better in the game.
