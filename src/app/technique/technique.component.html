          Having good technique is crucial when it comes to making precise shots. Even with a perfectly straight cue ball,
          many players struggle to hit their target when they start to feather the ball. One way to improve this is by
          focusing on two fixed points while feathering. This helps to maintain a straight line and improve accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>- The first key element in maintaining a straight line while feathering is the bridge. It's important to keep
          in mind that it can only serve as a fixed point if it stays steady and doesn't move.<br>
          - Another important fixed point to consider is the body. By keeping a steady and consistent posture,
          the body can serve as a reference point to ensure that the cue stick is moving in a straight line.</p>
        <p>
          To enhance the stability of the guidance cue, we can add two additional fixed points. To do this, we can lean
          over the table and rotate our shoulders by 90 degrees, while also contracting our chest and chin towards the cue.
          Initially, we should position the cue on the firing line and then allow our body to lean against the cue.
          This will simplify the process of guiding the cue while feathering.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/image/vincent_pos_001.png" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail rounded" alt="good position by table (Vincent from Blender Studio)" style="width: 1100px;">
        <p>
          <br>
          A common mistake among players is to move the cue towards their body when attempting to lean on it.
          This causes the cue to no longer be aligned with the line of fire, which can negatively impact accuracy.
          Instead, it's important to maintain the proper positioning of the cue while leaning on it to ensure proper
          shot alignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The location at which we grip the cue can greatly affect the movement of the pointer during feathering.
          Holding the cue too close to the end can result in limited movement and difficulty in adjusting for accuracy.
          On the other hand, gripping the cue too far away from the white ball can also cause a short movement of
          the cue and affect the accuracy of the shot. It is important to find a balance between the distance of
          the grip from the end of the cue and the distance from the white ball for optimal feathering.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Remember:</b> When taking a shot, it is important to not lean the cue against your body, but instead,
          let your body lean against the cue. This will ensure that your shot is stable and accurate.
          By keeping your body in the proper position and allowing it to support the cue, you can reduce the chances of
          any unwanted movements that can affect the accuracy of your shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that the handle of the cue is the core of the game. The shoulder joint is like the ball and it ultimately
          determines the position of the elbow. The elbow is a hinge joint, which means it only moves in one plane.
          The wrist is multi-functional and works in harmony with the elbow joint. The control of the cue is achieved
          through the fleshy network of skin between the thumb and forefinger. When gripping the cue, I hinge it with
          my index finger and close it with my thumb. This is the fundamental aspect of the grip. Then, by closing the
          other fingers and moving the cue forward and backward, I can develop the control of these fingers.
          The fingers should always be in contact with the cue during the shot.

        <br>
        <p>
          Proper finger development is crucial when pulling back the cue to ensure that the cue is guided parallel to
          the table. If the fingers are not developed, the cue will swing and the shot will not be accurate.
          Furthermore, if a grip is used without developing the fingers, the body will engage additional muscles
          and activate the shoulder joint, which can lead to mistakes. It's important to work on finger development
          to make sure that the cue is controlled and guided parallel to the table, without the need to use additional muscles.

        <br>
        <p>
          It's important to ensure that at the moment of contact between the cue tip and the cue ball, the forearm and
          cue form a right angle. This position aligns the cue most parallel to the table. If the cue is pulled back
          with the tip pointing upwards, it will not be parallel to the table at the moment of contact and can negatively
          impact the shot's accuracy. To have the best shot outcome, the cue should be parallel to the table at
          the moment of contact with the cue ball.

          Forming a proper bridge is important for accurate shots. Here's how to do it:<br>
          <b>1.</b> Place your palm flat on the table, spreading your fingers to the desired width.<br>
          <b>2.</b> Carefully lift your knuckles by pulling the pads of your fingers across the table,
          making sure that the entire pads are resting on the surface.<br>
          <b>3.</b> Keep your fingers straight as you slide your thumb into the middle of your fingers and lock it onto your
          index finger. This will provide stability for the bridge.<br>
          <b>4.</b> The final result should be an indentation that resembles a letter V, through which the cue can pass.
          This will provide a stable base for the cue and allow for precise shots.

        </h6>
        <p>
          The ability to properly position your hands and set a stable bridge while playing pool is affected by the
          position of the white ball on the table. It is important to note that the position of the other balls on the
          table does not play a role in this. When the cue ball is near the edge of the table, it can become more difficult
          to set a stable bridge. In these cases, it may be necessary to slightly adjust the position of your hands
          and the bridge to maintain proper form. Additionally, the distance between the bridge and the hand holding
          the cue should remain consistent, and any adjustments made to the position of the sternum should be reflected
          in the position of the hand holding the cue. While these guidelines can help improve your snooker game,
          it is important to remember that they are not set in stone and may vary depending on the situation.

          Bridge on the edge of the table.
        </h6>
        <p>
          When the cue ball is close to the cushion and a traditional bridge is not possible, there are alternative
          bridge techniques that can be used. One option is the "mechanic's bridge", where the base of the bridge
          hand is positioned on the cushion and the fingers support the cue. Another option is the "fingertip bridge",
          where the fingertips of the bridge hand are used to support the cue, rather than the base of the hand.
          A third option is the "rail bridge" where the cue is rested on the rail of the pool table instead of the
          bridge hand. These alternative bridges can be used to make a shot when a traditional bridge is not possible
          due to the position of the cue ball.

        </h6>
        <p>
          Maintaining proper posture and stability is crucial for making accurate and powerful strokes while playing snooker.
          The stability of the bridge hand and the body play an important role in this. Keeping your body immobile
          and stable during a shot will improve your game. To achieve this, it's important to focus on maintaining
          a balanced and steady stance while you play. This can be done by keeping your feet firmly planted on the ground,
          and distributing your weight evenly between them. Additionally, it's important to engage core muscles to keep
          your body still and in control during a shot. By working on stability and maintaining a stationary body,
          you'll be able to make more accurate and powerful strokes while playing snooker.

        <br>
        <p>
          To establish a proper stance while playing snooker, it's important to first determine your firing line,
          which is the line that your cue will follow during the shot. To do this, align your right leg with the
          line of the shot, as this is the leg that will hold the cue. Your left leg should be positioned slightly
          wider than your hips to provide added stability. To increase longitudinal stability, which is stability
          along the line of the shot, move your left leg forward about 30cm and bend it slightly at the knee.
          Your right leg should remain straight. This stance will provide comfort and stability when striking the white ball.

          Players frequently encounter difficulty with unintended cue rotations, as they struggle to properly align
          the cue with the white ball. This results in missed shots, as the ball fails to enter the pocket.
        </p>
        <h6>What are they starting to do?</h6>
        <p>
          Another issue that arises from improper cue alignment is that players may adjust their targeting, believing
          they are shooting correctly, while in reality they have altered the line of impact by counteracting
          the off-center stroke on the white ball. This can lead to confusion and frustration, as players may think
          they are making the correct shots, but the ball still falls short of the pocket.

        <br>
        <p>
          One technique to ensure proper cue alignment on the white ball is to use a bridge loop. This involves placing
          the bridge cue on the table and leaning over the white ball to view the target from above. By doing this,
          you can see where you are actually aiming and how your brain interprets this. You can then adjust your aim
          and perception of the center of the white ball, so that your brain correctly interprets the center of the cue ball.
          This can be done by repeating this process often enough, so that the brain will change its interpretation and
          perception of the center will change, allowing you to strike the cue ball accurately.

          Two exercises that check if you play straight:
        </h6>
        <p>
          A simple exercise to determine if you are striking the center of the cue ball is to aim the cue ball over
          the spots of the colored balls on the table. Position the cue ball slightly in front of the point of the brown ball,
          and use that point as a reference to check if you are hitting the center. After each shot, try to keep the cue
          still so that white ball it hits the tip (cue) upon return. This will help you to gauge if you are hitting
          the center of the cue ball and make adjustments as necessary.<br>
          <b>(Cue ball by points - #101)</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          A more advanced exercise to check if you are hitting the center of the white ball is to aim at the white ball
          and hit it on the blue. After the blue ball passes through the point of the pink and black ball,
          it should deflect off the cushion and return to hit the white ball. This exercise will help you to
          determine if you are hitting the center of the white ball by observing the trajectory of the blue ball
          and adjusting accordingly.<br>

          Once you have determined the line of fire and made any necessary adjustments, it is important to execute the
          cue action smoothly and calmly. Avoid any quick or sudden movements, and try to keep the number of repetitions consistent.
          Before making the stroke, take a momentary pause to ensure that your aim and execution are correct.
          This will help you to make accurate shots and improve your overall performance.
        </p>
        <h6>
          Why the cue action?
        </h6>
        <p>
          The cue action is the deliberate and controlled movement of the cue  in order to make the shot. It is important
          to keep the cue action calm, so that your motor skills are relaxed and the shot is executed smoothly.
          This will help to ensure that the cue ball is hit as precisely as possible.
        </p>
        <h6>
          Why the pause?
        </h6>
        <p>
          The pause before the shot is crucial to maintaining control and accuracy. Without a pause, the cue may
          accelerate too quickly upon impact, causing the shot to be executed poorly. This can lead to a lack of
          control and difficulty in keeping the cue in a straight line. Pausing before the shot will help to maintain
          control and ensure a smooth and accurate execution.

          2. Second extraction<br>
          3. Third extraction<br>
          4. Fourth pullback and first pause<br>
          5. Smoothly bringing the cue forward with appropriate dynamics<br>
          6. The strike is followed by a natural deceleration of the cue and a second pause<br>
          7. In this position after the shot we stay for a while
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to the cue action, we can select the strength of the impact. If I want to play a light stroke my
          feathering should have short lashings, while if I want to play a strong shot of the blow should be longer.

          <b>Where do you look when hitting the white ball?</b> When striking the white ball, you should look at
          the ball that you are trying to hit. It is not recommended to look at the ball that has just been played
          (the cue ball) as this can affect your aim and accuracy.
        </p>
        <h6>
          This can be done in three ways:
        </h6>
        <p>
          <b>The first way -</b> We prepare to strike and look at the white ball and the ball being played, keeping our
          eyes focused on the cue as it moves back and forth. We make sure to watch the cue as it moves along the line
          of impact. This method allows us to see how the cue is moving and adjust the strike if necessary. However,
          it takes more focus to keep our eyes on the cue instead of the ball being played.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The second way -</b> We prepare to strike by keeping our eyes on the white ball and the ball to be struck.
          We focus on the point of impact and make the strike without looking at the cue as it retreats.
          This method allows for quick and precise strikes, but it can be difficult to gauge the power
          of the shot without visually tracking the cue.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The third way -</b> We prepare to strike by looking at the cue ball and aiming, then we focus on the cue
          as it moves back and forth. We make sure to watch the cue as it stops before the strike, then we look at
          the ball being played and strike. This method allows for precision and control of the cue, as well as
          giving us ample time to focus on the ball being played.

        <h6>
          Where to position the dominant eye and where to hold the head during impact?
        </h6>
        <p>
          When the players fold up to hit and start the cue action, you may notice that some players cue more under the
          right or left eye. This is because they have one eye more dominant, so if the right eye is dominant
          cue will be more under the right eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine which eye is dominant, follow these steps:<br>
          <b>1.</b> Place a ball on a table.<br>
          <b>2.</b> Cut a hole in a piece of paper and hold it in front of your straightened arms.<br>
          <b>3.</b> Look through the hole at the ball and close your left eye. If you can still see the ball, your right eye is dominant.<br>
          <b>4.</b> Repeat the process, but this time close your right eye. If the ball disappears, your left eye is dominant.<br>

          Hitting balls straight when our technique is correct does not causes a big problem, but when we play
          the balls at a certain angle in relation to the pocket the stairs begin. How to hit the white ball
          on the played ball so that it falls into the pocket. How to choose the right angle for pocketing?
          This is the most common question asked by novice snooker players how to properly pocket and how
          to recognize the suitable angles.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we have a play of the white cue ball at an angle to the cue ball played and the pocket, we can
          approach the strike in two ways ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The first way</b> is to practice hitting angles where the cue ball and the  ball played meld into a full ball
          (that is hitting straight), on 3/4 the ball, 1/2 the ball or 1/4 the ball. After practicing these angles
          we will begin to recognize whether the stroke is on 1/2 the ball or maybe on 3/4 the ball and by making
          slight slight adjustment we will be able to pocket the ball into the pocket.

        <br>
        <p>
          <b>The second way</b> is to stand in line of the ball being played and pocket imagining the ball tangent to the
          ball played on the line leading to the pocket. Such ball is called a "ghost ball." Now without taking our
          eyes off the the imaginary ball we assemble to shot aiming perfectly at the center of the "ghost ball".

        <br>
        <p>
          The best way to improve efficiency or simply learning is to combine the two methods. That is,
          combine regular practice of hammering from several angles, for example, at 20 times from each angle and,
          before each hit, imagine a ghost ball. Such a combination gives us a lot of information feedback and over
          time we will automatically and intuitively correctly fold in the right angle for a shot. When learning
          angles the most important thing is routine and repetition because this is how we way we acquire and
          consolidate both motor and memory information and memory information of recognizing and inserting from angles.

          What to pay attention to when practicing strokes with rotation. To play snooker well, you must be proficient
          in three basic strokes. Hitting with progressive rotation, without rotation and with backward rotation.
        </p>
        <h6>
          IMPORTANT: When giving a rotation, our tip must be well on the chalked.

          <b>Top spin</b> shot, to perform such strike we need to raise the bridge of the hand and then hit the top of the cue
          ball. Such a stroke causes the imparting of a rotation progressive and after hitting the ball played the
          white ball rolls forward behind the played ball.

        <p>
          <b>Stop ball.</b> Hitting the center of the cue ball without rotation, in order to perform such strike
          we need to slightly lower the bridge to aim closer to the center, such a strike causes sliding the cue
          ball down the cloth to the played ball, the white ball remains in place of the cue ball played ball.

        <p>
          <b>Back spin.</b> Strike rotation reverse, to perform such a strike we need to put the bridge of the hand
          lay flat on the table, and then strike down the ball white, such a stroke causes imparting backward rotation
          to the cue ball and after striking the played ball the white ball starts to go back backwards.

        <h6>
          IMPORTANT: With back spin, it is important to have a parallel guidance of the cue. Failure to maintain
          parallelism and stability guidance of the cue will cause the white ball to jump.

          Once we have mastered the pocketing of the cue balls using a top spin, stop ball and back spin, it's time
          to introduce the intricacies using the side stroke at the ball. The use of side rotation will have many
          effects on the snooker table snooker table, but its greatest effect will occur when it hits the
          into a edge on table.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with backward and forward rotation progressive the more lateral rotation we apply the greater the effect
          of deviation. When impact will be maximum on the left side of the white ball. Cue ball after bouncing off
          the edge on table a will have greatest deviation to the left. When our kĳ hits closer to the center
          the deviation will be smaller.

          It is important to remember that when you use side rotation, there will always be slightly deviated from
          the intended shot line. Therefore, when aiming, you need to keep this in mind and take
          into consideration when using side rotation.

          If you put your hand on the table and rub it along from the top of the of the table towards the point of
          the black ball, the material appears quite quite smooth. On the other hand, with a reverse movement from
          the point of black up the table, you will feel the tiny hairs of the of the cloth. Such an arrangement
          of the cloth has quite an effect on the rolling of the cue ball especially when hitting with lateral rotation.

          If you strike the white ball with rotation toward the point of the point of the black cue ball,
          the white ball travels slightly in an arc.<br>
          If you strike the white ball with side rotation but in the direction of the
          base from the point of the black ball the white ball flies slightly on a slant.

          Both beginners and some players have some problems when using auxiliary instruments. Cue must move in the plane of
          impact straight and stable. If the feathering deviates from the line of aiming, the cue flies to one side
          or the other when the shot is fired side which causes a miss. We just want to keep the cue on a flat
          surface and hit the ball straight.

          When practicing strikes with instruments, try to lay the device along the strike, and guide the stick directly
          over and along the instrument. This is a very good reference to check that your strokes are in a straight line.

          Stressful situations are the inseparable companion of every competitor, especially when a particular shot
          is decisive. Sometimes a seemingly simple shot can turn out to be difficult due to the weight of the shot.
          We perceive stress as a feeling of discomfort in a particular situation, understood as a state of tension.
          Tense neck and shoulder muscles is our body's reaction to stress, which makes it very difficult
          to perform a correct strike.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stressors activate complex response mechanisms both physiological and psychological. It begins to secrete
          hormones of stress, such as cortisol, as well as adrenaline which, in the case of a game like is snooker is
          not advisable. Snooker player during the stroke should as calmly as possible bring out the hit so as not to
          introduce unwanted additional body movements.

        <h6>
          How to deal with stress?
        </h6>
        <p>
          <b>The first</b> and main way to cope with stress is to develop, practice the best possible technique.
          Technique is the foundation of our game, which makes us better than another player in a stressful situation.
          To develop a good technique you need to devote hours a day to train technique.<br>
          <b>The second</b> way is breathing exercises. By a few seconds before an important impact, focus on your own
          breathing, take a deep inhale and then slowly let the air out this will cause your body will begin to relax
          and your breathing will regulate itself.<br>
          <b>The third</b> way equally important is visualization, the idea is that before each stroke you should be
          able to visualize your stroke as the cue ball hits the ball being played, which falls into the pocket
          while the cue ball stops in the position as planned.
